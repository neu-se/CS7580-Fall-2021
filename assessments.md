# Assessment Overview
A summary of the three mechanisms that will be used to assess your performance in the course is below. 
Please note the [course grading policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link policies.md%}#grading), which describes how these three assignments will be used to determine your final course grade.

## Participation
This class is a research seminar, and it is the most fun and rewarding when everyone comes to each class meeting prepared to discuss the assigned paper. 
I ask that you demonstrate your preparation by being ready to engage in discussion. You need not have complete mastery of the paper that we are discussing --- but having a comment to offer or question to ask is always appreciated.
If you do not feel comfortable participating in class, please reach out to me --- I would like to create an environment that is welcoming for discussion, and would not like to inadvertently penalize a student who struggled to find a moment to speak up in class.
As an alternative, you may also (or instead) e-mail me a brief (3-5 sentence) reaction to the paper that we will be discussing in class.

I will provide you with weekly feedback on your participation in class, at the level of "check", "check minus" and "check plus." I am happy to provide opportunities throughout the term to replace check minuses with checks on the basis of additional discussions.

## Reflection Paper
In addition to discussing papers in class, you will be asked to summarize your reaction to the papers in the first half of class in the form of a *reflection paper*. The reflection paper provides you to an opportunity to apply critical reasoning skills in the context of the research papers that we discuss in class. In the reflection paper, you will summarize and respond to at least 8 of the 14 papers that we will discuss in the first 6 weeks of class. The expected length of the reflection paper is roughly 6 pages (double spaced!).

A rubric for the reflection paper will be posted on the first day of class.

## Implementation Project
The project will involve a hands-on application of the techniques and tools that we discuss in class, and can be completed either individually or in a group of at most two. Topics for the project will be discussed in the first six weeks of class, and your specific project topic will be finalized soon after. At a high level, project topics will include two tracks:

1. Research track: These projects are intended for students interested in pushing the state-of-the-art in program analysis and software testing tools. These projects will involve creating a prototype tool that implements some new concept. Example research projects might include: extending [Phosphor](https://github.com/gmu-swe/phosphor) or optimizing or enhancing [EvoSuite](http://www.evosuite.org/). If you would like to create a formal writeup of your research project, most of these projects will be suitable for publication in an academic workshop.
2. Industry track: These projects are intended primarily for students who are interested in honing their programming and software engineering skills, by taking a state-of-the-art idea, and transitioning it to the state-of-practice. These projects will involve taking some idea that we talk about in class and implementing it in a popular tool, for instance, improving the [flaky test detector built into Maven](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html), optimizing the [JaCoCo coverage tool](https://www.jacoco.org), or hacking on the regression test selection system in [Clover](http://openclover.org). These projects are intended to be of sufficient quality that you can submit a pull request to have your changes included in the open source tool. Think about next time you are on an interview and you are asked if you are familiar with (insert name of tool here), and you can say "Oh yes, and I have contributed code that made its way in to X."

A detailed rubric for the project will be posted on the first day of class.
