title: One more week of material
week: 7
date: 2021-10-22

Due to ambiguities in the course schedules, we had one week less of content than there are weeks in the semester (or so it seems). I've added new readings that will be very relevant for our recent discussions on fuzzing evaluations in week 8, and shifted the rest of the schedule down by a week. The project is now due on Dec 17.
